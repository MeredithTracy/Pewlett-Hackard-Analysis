# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
Pewlett Hackard is looking to the future to prepare for the upcoming wave of potential retirees in the next few years. We have been tasked to assist Bobby in Human Resources to analyze the available data to determine who is eligible for retirement and how many potential positions Pewlett Hackard will need to hire. 

## Results
Based on our analysis, we can determine that:
-	41,380 employees will be eligible for retirement based on their age.

-	Senior level positions will be impacted the most with 29,414 Senior Engineer positions and 28,254 Senior Staff positions. 
-	Engineers and staff are also significantly impacted with 14,222 (engineers) and 12,243 (staff) positions coming available. 
-	Management will have two position coming available which is something to watch for as those positions will require a deeper understanding and training of the internal workings of the company and will likely prefer to be included in the mentorship program. 

## Summary
-	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
    - Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill 90,398 positions over the course of the next few years during the wave of retirements. 
    - A majority of these in senior level positions. 


-	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

    - There are enough eligible retirement-ready employees to work within the mentorship program. 
    - Currently, there are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This will not be enough people to fill all of the positions so they will need to expand the eligibility requirements or decide on other new hires. 

## Opportunities for further analysis:
- I would expect that budgeting would be critical to understand in the upcoming impact of the wave of retirements. As we saw in our analysis, there will be a lot of hiring done over the next few years and making sure your annual budget supports that or finding a way to manage that will be critical. 
- We could also continue to work within the mentorship eligibility analysis to see how we could make changes to the requirements to widen the pool of eligible candidates to aid in the adjustment process.
